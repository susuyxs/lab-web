          <h3>Short Bio</h3>
          <p>Dr. JunRui Zhang is a recipient of the National Young Talents Program. He received his Ph.D. from EPFL (QS World University Ranking 26), under the supervision of Prof. Adrian M. Ionescu (Fellow of the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences). For years, he has been engaged in next-generation semiconductor microelectronic devices, high-performance heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging, CMOS-compatible biosensors, and application-specific integrated circuits for medical applications. As a technical co-founder, he co-established an innovative medical device company, raising over 100 million RMB. The developed biomarker sensor technology was transferred to a Swiss tech company and attracted investments of about 90 million RMB, including from Mayo Clinic, the world's leading medical institution. He has led two sub-projects of the Ministry of Science and Technology's key R&D program.</p>
